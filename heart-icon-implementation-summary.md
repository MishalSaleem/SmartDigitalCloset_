# Heart Icon Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added heart icon (favorite) functionality to all interest category pages that were missing it. This allows users to add items from these categories to their favorites.

## Pages Updated
The following pages now have heart icon functionality:
- Music.razor
- Reading.razor
- Photography.razor
- Movies.razor
- Gymnastics.razor

## Changes Made to Each Page
For each page, the following changes were made:

1. **Updated page directives and injected services**:
   ```razor
   @using System
   @inject NavigationManager Navigation
   @inject Blazored.SessionStorage.ISessionStorageService SessionStorage
   @inject SmartDigitalCloset.Data.FavoritesService FavoritesService
   ```

2. **Added heart icon button to each item**:
   ```razor
   <div class="car-card" style="position:relative;">
       <img src="@item.Url" alt="@item.Name" loading="lazy" class="artist-img" />
       <div class="car-label">@item.Name</div>
       <button @onclick="() => SaveFavorite(item)" style="position:absolute;top:8px;right:8px;background:none;border:none;cursor:pointer;">
           <span style="font-size:1.3rem;color:@(IsFavorite(item) ? "#e60023" : "#bbb");">&#10084;</span>
       </button>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Added code for favorites handling**:
   - Added `favoriteNames` HashSet to store favorite item names
   - Updated `OnInitializedAsync` to load favorites
   - Added `SaveFavorite` method to add/remove items from favorites
   - Added `IsFavorite` method to check if an item is favorited

## Consistency
All interest pages now consistently offer the same favorites functionality, allowing users to:
- Click a heart icon to add an item to their favorites
- Click again to remove from favorites
- See the heart icon in red for favorited items and gray for non-favorited items

## Testing
The changes were verified to ensure:
- No compilation errors
- Consistency with other pages that already had heart icons (like Fashion, DIY, etc.)
- Proper integration with the FavoritesService
